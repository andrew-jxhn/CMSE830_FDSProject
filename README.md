## Project Overview

This project explores the **DataCo Smart Supply Chain** dataset to gain insights into the supply chain performance, focusing on key metrics such as sales, profit, and delivery time.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

- **IoT and Data Growth**: The widespread adoption of IoT has generated vast amounts of data, valuable for uncovering insights and enhancing decision-making.
  
- **Customer Segmentation**: This project utilizes the DataCo dataset to conduct customer segmentation, enabling better customer understanding and revenue growth.
  
- **Model Selection Challenge**: With multiple data analysis methods and models available, choosing the right one is crucial as model performance varies with data parameters.
  
- **Comparative Studies**: Prior studies (e.g., Carbonneau, Hill, Vakili, Ahmed) have compared traditional forecasting methods with neural networks and machine learning models, revealing varying levels of performance across techniques.
  
- **Project Objective**: This study plans to compare 9 machine learning classifiers and 7 regression models against neural networks. Key tasks include fraud detection, late delivery prediction, sales forecasting, and demand prediction.

**Model Performance (Subject to Change)**:
- **Classification models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, Random Forest, etc., evaluated for accuracy, recall, and F1 score.
- **Regression models**: Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, and others, assessed with MAE and RMSE for sales and demand prediction.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Analysis (IDA)**: Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key trends and patterns in the data.
- **Missingness Analysis**: Understand the distribution of missing values in the dataset.
